# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hangman

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website where a player can access a game of hangman.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would create an entry that would present with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find. The player would have to guess the correct word of the game. If the get a letter wrong the data would return as piece of the hangman. If the hangman is completed, then the player loses and the game will be over.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning on combining this project with a project from another class as my other MIS courses do not have a final project.


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I'm not colloborating with any other classmates.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will defintely accomplish a program that will run and return if the answer entered into the program is valid or not valid.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If the player guess the correct word, then I would like the program to return as "Congratulations, You Win." If the player loses, I would like the program to accomplish a function that would return as the whole hangman complete and return with "Sorry, You Lose."


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to accomplish a program that runs, with the most effiecient codes since there are several ways to create a code that runs a gaming program. However, even though there may be sevral solutions to run the program, I want a to create a code that is simple and not overly complicated.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what? 

First, I would have to create a heading and paragraph that explains the steps. Then I woukd have also add shapes to the program that would be included so it would be returned if the player guesses the incorrect word. If the player guesses the write letter then the program would be added to the blank spaces. The player would keep guessing the letter to the word until the player wins or loses. If they win or lose, the program would return text informing them if they won or lost.
